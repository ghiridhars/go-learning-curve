# CLI File Processor Project Specification

## Project Overview
A command-line tool that processes text files with concurrent processing capabilities.

## Current Implementation

### 1. Basic File Operations
```bash
# Basic file reading with concurrent processing
.\fileprocessor.exe read sample.txt

# Read with word count and character count
.\fileprocessor.exe read -c -n sample.txt

# Specify number of workers
.\fileprocessor.exe read -w 4 -c -n sample.txt

# Search for pattern
.\fileprocessor.exe read -p "search_text" sample.txt
```

### 2. Implemented Features
- Concurrent file processing with worker pools
- Configurable number of workers (default: 4)
- Word count (-c flag)
- Character count (-n flag)
- Pattern search (-p flag)
- Thread-safe result aggregation
- Chunk-based file processing (1000 lines per chunk)

### 3. Project Structure
```

├── cmd/
│   └── root.go           # Main command definitions
├── internal/
│   └── processor/
│       └── process.go    # File processing logic
├── main.go
└── go.mod
```

### 4. Core Components

#### File Chunk Processing
```go
type FileChunk struct {
    Lines          []string
    WordCount      int
    CharacterCount int
    MatchedLines   []string
}
```

#### Statistics Collection
```go
var totalStats struct {
    words      int
    chars      int
    lines      int
    sync.Mutex
}
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Planned Features
- Progress bar for large files
- Enhanced error handling
- Memory usage optimization
- Additional statistics
- Output format options (JSON, CSV)
- Directory traversal
- Regular expression support

### 2. Future Enhancements
- Support for compressed files
- Different character encodings
- Interactive mode
- Batch processing

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
.\fileprocessor.exe read sample.txt
```

### With All Features
```bash
.\fileprocessor.exe read -w 4 -c -n -p "pattern" sample.txt
```

### Flags
- `-w, --workers`: Number of concurrent workers
- `-c, --word-count`: Enable word counting
- `-n, --character-count`: Enable character counting
- `-p, --pattern`: Search for pattern in text

## Current Status
✅ Basic concurrent processing
✅ Word counting
✅ Character counting
✅ Pattern searching
✅ Thread-safe result aggregation
